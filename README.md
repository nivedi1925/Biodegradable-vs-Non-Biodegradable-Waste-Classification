# Biodegradable-vs-Non-Biodegradable-Waste-Classification
A deep learning project that classifies images of waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories using transfer learning with ResNet50. This is a computer vision project aimed at supporting waste segregation through intelligent image classification.
Project Overview

    Goal: Automate classification of waste for better recycling and disposal.

    Model Used: ResNet50 (pretrained on ImageNet).

    Dataset: Non and Biodegradable Waste Dataset from Kaggle.

    Accuracy Achieved:
