# Biodegradable-vs-Non-Biodegradable-Waste-Classification

üìå Project Overview

This computer vision project aims to automate waste segregation by classifying images of waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories. Leveraging the power of deep learning and transfer learning, the project utilizes the ResNet50 architecture to perform image classification with high accuracy. The final model is deployed as a web application to demonstrate real-time predictions.

üéØ Objective

To build an intelligent system that:
- Helps in automated waste sorting.
- Supports environmental sustainability through smart waste management.
- Provides a user-friendly web interface for image-based classification

    
üîç Key Features

- Transfer Learning with ResNet50: Utilizes pretrained ResNet50 for feature extraction and fine-tuning for binary classification.
- Image Preprocessing: Includes resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to improve model generalization.
- Web App Deployment: Simple UI built with Streamlit for uploading waste images and getting real-time predictions.

    Others:  NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas


üß† Model Architecture

    Base: ResNet50 (frozen base layers)

    Added layers:

        Global Average Pooling

        Dense (ReLU)

        Dropout (optional)

        Dense (Softmax for 2-class classification)
        
üèãÔ∏è Training Details

    Epochs: 4

    Optimizer: Adam

    Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

    Batch Size: 32

    Learning Rate: 0.0001

üìä Results & Evaluation

    Metric	Validation	Test
    
    Accuracy	98%	90%
    
    Loss	~0.02	~0.30


üîé  Observations:

- Slight overfitting observed (val accuracy > test accuracy).
- Likely due to low number of epochs( Contraints here is limited computational capabilities).
- Potential improvements: more epochs, early stopping, regularization, fine-tuning more layers.
