# Biodegradable-vs-Non-Biodegradable-Waste-Classification

📌 Project Overview

This computer vision project aims to automate waste segregation by classifying images of waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories. Leveraging the power of deep learning and transfer learning, the project utilizes the ResNet50 architecture to perform image classification with high accuracy. The final model is deployed as a web application to demonstrate real-time predictions.

    Accuracy	98%	90%
    
    Loss	~0.02	~0.30


🔎  Observations:

- Slight overfitting observed (val accuracy > test accuracy).
- Likely due to low number of epochs( Contraints here is limited computational capabilities).
- Potential improvements: more epochs, early stopping, regularization, fine-tuning more layers.
